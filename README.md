Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Summary

Missing Values: Identified and handled missing values by filling categorical columns with the mode and numerical columns with the mean.

Duplicates: Removed duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.

Text Standardization: Cleaned text columns like model and make for consistent formatting (e.g., lowercase,).

Data Type Conversion: Converted columns to appropriate types — year to integer, date columns to datetime format.

Column Renaming: Renamed all column headers to a uniform format(lowercase to title).

Final Output: Produced a clean, structured dataset ready for analysis or modeling. I have used the same dataset that i cleaned in the previous task,i upload it in powerbi and started creating different charts for different fields. I have created two pages in powerbi one is dashboard and other one is summary page I will upload the dataset google drive link below as it is too big to upload in the github
